                <td>A cheetah has very lean muscles, slender legs and an athletic, flexible spine. Their wide nostrils allow them to breathe in lots of oxygen when running, and their lungs and hearts are built to cope with all of that extra oxygen.

                    But cheetahs don’t run flat out for long, they only do it to catch prey. And afterwards it takes 20 minutes for their breathing and body temperature to get back to normal.
                    
                    Cheetahs mate throughout the year and, after a 3 month pregnancy, mothers give birth to 2 to 4
                    kittens. Every few days, a mother will move her babies to a new hiding place to protect them from
                    hungry predators. At about 6 weeks, the new arrivals start to follow their mother and eat from her
                    kills.</td>

                <td>Chimps each have individual features, just like we do, including skin colour, hair cover and facial shapes. They also have opposable thumbs and toes which they can use to grip tools, long arms for ‘knuckle walking’ and reaching, and extreme strength which helps them moving through canopies.

                    They live in large, complex social groups, which are essential for their ability to learn and develop.
                     They’re entirely affected by the groups they line in, from where and what they eat, who they mate with and how much power they’ve got.
                      They are led by an alpha male who controls the group, settling fights, choosing where to feed and having first choice of a female mate. 
                      Bonding is an important part of living within a group, and chimps bond by grooming each other, similarly to how humans shake hands.</td>

                <td>Typically reddish brown or dark mahogany, with coarse bristly hairs, male buffalos are bigger than females. Both grow backwards sweeping horns though those of the male are larger and thicker. They have big, drooping fringed ears and excellent hearing which alerts them to any potential dangers in the wild.

                    Congo buffalo herds can vary in size but the core is made up of females and their offspring with sub-herds forming part of the larger whole. Incredibly, herds display behaviour which suggests they can operate collectively to protect both individuals or the herd itself from danger as well as make collective decisions.
                    
                    They have very few predators, apart form humans who continue to trophy hunt them. When attacked, herds bring calves to the middle to protect them. By sticking together predators find it harder to pick off a single animal</td>

                <td>Their horns are made from a protein called keratin (just like our fingernails and hair). Their thick skins protect them from sharp thorns when browsing and their ears are able to manoeuver to source where sounds are coming from.

                    Black rhinos are most active at night, browsing for their food of trees, bushes and shrubs, helped by their powerful sense of smell much more than by their poor eyesight.
                     Despite the impression that they are solitary animals, rhinos have been known to be semi-social when habitat dictates, but adult males do tend to live alone when not mating.</td>

                <td>Capybaras are highly social animals and can be found living in small herds on grassland, in tropical rainforest, as well as in wetlands across most of the continent.

                    Their bodies have been specially adapted for swimming – with webbed feet and their eyes, ears and nostrils located on top of their heads – and will spend much of their time in the water. They often submerge themselves in water to avoid detection by predators such as jaguars, anacondas and caiman.

                <td>Flamingos live in big flocks and live for around 30 years. Their iconic pink feathers are made waterproof by a preen gland which releases an oil.
                     The colouration of their feathers comes from the tiny plants and invertebrates they eat!

                    Flamingos are monogamous birds, usually laying only one egg per year, In the breeding season
                    you will see them strutting together, flashing their heads from left to right, or saluting each other by
                    standing still like statues, heads high in the air and enormous wings open wide.
                    
                    The drainage of Caribbean flamingos habitat and the creation of salt pans has had an impact on the population of this species. 
                    Habitat loss due to land reclamation for development and holiday resorts in some areas is also a threat to these flamingos.</td>

                <td><header id="Animals">Asian Elephant</header><img src="image/asianelephant.jpg" alt="Asian Elephant"></td>
                <td>Asian elephants are smaller than their African cousins, and Intelligent and sociable, they live together in family groups and are usually led by the oldest female.
                     Their most distinctive feature is of course their long trunks which can be very powerful, but also very delicate when needed to forage for food.
                    They need to eat a lot and can spend two thirds of a day feeding. They eat grasses, tree bark, roots, leaves and the like.
                    Their ivory tusks help with digging, stripping bark from trees and fighting. Not all male Asian elephants have tusks! But both males and females can have tushes, which are incisor teeth that grow to just below the bottom lip.
                    
                    An elephant’s ears are used to keep the animal cool as they radiate heat, and Asian elephants have smaller ears than African ones. Despite the fact that their trunks are sophisticated long noses, Asian elephants have a finger at the end enabling the elephant to handle small items.
                     African elephants have two fingers at the end of their trunks.
                  Elephants spend almost 22 months pregnant with a calf. That’s the longest amount of time for any mammal! Female elephants (cows), give birth to one calf every two to four years.</td>

                <td><header id="Animals"><img src="image/ecuadoramazonparrot.jpg" alt="Ecuador Amazon Parrot"></header></td>
                <td>Ecuadorian Amazon parrots were previously thought to be a sub-species of a common Amazon parrot so were offered very little protection.
                     In 2014, as a result of our research, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) awarded them full species status and listed them as endangered.
                      They gained protection and became a conservation priority, as there’s possibly fewer than 600 individuals left in the wild.
                    They nest in the cavities of tree trunks and branches, preferring trees with softer bark. They need the
                    trunk or branch to be wide enough to host a cavity with an entrance hole of 15 cm wide. 
                    These cavities are usually made by woodpeckers then expanded by the parrots before nesting.
                     They’ll roost in mangroves overnight and fly through forests each day to feed using their strong flight feathers to help them travel between roosting and feeding habitats.</td>
            </tr>
            <td><header id="Animals">Rothschild Giraffe</header><img src="image/giraffe.jpg" alt="Giraffe"></td>
            <td>Their tongues can measure up to 45cm long – great for helping them pull down leaves, shoots, bark and flowers off tree branches to eat.
                 They have a special valve in their neck that stops the blood rushing to their head when they bend down to drink.
                You can tell Rothschilds apart from other types of giraffe because they have no markings on their lower legs.
                 They’re also the taller than other giraffe species. Their name comes from the founder of the Tring Museum, Lionel Walter, the 2nd Baron Rothschild.               
                They live in the open woodlands, savannahs and grasslands of Uganda and Kenya where they live in small herds, with males and females only mixing for mating.
                 It takes up to sixteen months for a baby giraffe to gestate and mothers usually birth just one baby at a time.                
                Giraffes necks are long, but they actually contain the same number of bones (vertebra) as humans (seven). Males use their strong neck as weapons to fight over females!              
                Their large hooves are covered in a thick keratin coating and they use them to kick chasing predators. A single kick can kill a lion!</td>
            <tr>
                <td><header id="Animals">Jaguar</header><img src="image/jaguar.jpg" alt="Jaguar"></td>
                <td>‘Beast of prey’ is thought to be the meaning of the word ‘jaguar’, originally ‘yaguara’ from the Tupian language.
                    Solitary animals, they mark their territory by clawing trees, and live and hunt alone. They come together only for the purpose of mating. It takes 90 – 110 days for gestation and a mother will have between 1 and 4 kittens who will stay with her for up to 2 years.                    
                    Whilst jaguars hunt mainly on the ground, they do climb trees to pounce on their prey. Their limbs are short and thick set, making jaguars particularly adept at climbing and swimming.
                     Their enormously powerful jaws, combined with their ability to climb and swim, gives them a varied diet, ranging from fish and turtles, mammals like tapirs and monkeys and armoured skinned animals like crocodiles as well. They have the most powerful bite of all the big cats.                  
                    Their hunting helps to prevent overgrazing of vegetation by keeping herbivore populations under
                    control.Their coats can look very different! They can be yellow with black spots or look black all over. 
                    This is caused by a natural genetic mutation. There is no such species as a black panther; this is just a cat with a dark colour genetic mutation known as melanism.</td>
